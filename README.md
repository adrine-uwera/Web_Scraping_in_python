Here is the URL link to an amazon web page: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=bsm_nav_pill_print/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_bsmpill_1c1_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-1&pf_rd_r=JSFR919BB1373W4FETRV&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=65e3ce24-654c-43fb-a17b-86a554348820&pf_rd_i=16857165011]
This page has the bestselling books of amazon.

The program reads this web page and gives back a list of the 10 most expensive books (among the most popular, books with many reviews).

The task was about analyzing how I approach a new problem and how I would make use of python libraries to solve the same.

In this process, I had to start by reading python official documentation related to "URLS" and explore the python libraries to collect data from the given website link and process it using my python skills to retrieve the relevant information.

## Prompt: 
Implement the solution as per your plans using the identified libraries and process the retrieved web information as you find fit.Â
